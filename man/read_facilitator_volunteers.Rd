\description{
Facilitator volunteers are loaded into a Google Sheet (eventually via a form,
perhaps), then parsed into an RDS. This function loads the RDS if it is
up-to-date, or updates the RDS if it is out of date. Once this function has
been called in a session, it always returns the same result unless it is told
to refresh.
